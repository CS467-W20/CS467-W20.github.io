# Cross-Site Scripting
Cross-Site scripting is a method of exploitation that injects code whether that be reflected or stored on to a webpage. Stored cross-site scripting attacks grant an adversary the ability to upload malicious code onto a database accessed by the targeted web-application. Once this code is successfully uploaded to the web application, the adversary waits for an unsuspecting user to access the targeted web application andrun the malicious code. This code can allow an adversary to do a variaty of attacks that range from stealing user cookies, to cause users to be redirected to a malicious web application.

## Exercise
For this exercise we will be conducting a stored cross-site scripting attack on https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com. The attack will cause other unsuspecting users to be redirected to a seperate webpage. For this example we will use http://www.google.com.

1. Access https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com and login with the following credentials username: user123@gmail.com password: 123user.
