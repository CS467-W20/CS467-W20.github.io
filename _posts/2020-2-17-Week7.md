# Cross-Site Scripting
Cross-Site scripting is a method of exploitation that injects code whether that be reflected or stored on to a webpage. Stored cross-site scripting attacks grant an adversary the ability to upload malicious code onto a database accessed by the targeted web-application. Once this code is successfully uploaded to the web application, the adversary waits for an unsuspecting user to access the targeted web application andrun the malicious code. This code can allow an adversary to do a variaty of attacks that range from stealing user cookies, to cause users to be redirected to a malicious web application.

## Exercise
For this exercise we will be conducting a stored cross-site scripting attack on https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com. The attack will cause other unsuspecting users to be redirected to a seperate webpage. For this example we will use http://www.google.com.

1. Access https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com and login with the following credentials username: user123@gmail.com password: 123user.

2. Take advantage of the vulnerable webpage by moifying the UTL: https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com/lists to https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com/lists/1. This allows you to access a specific list owned my another unknown user within the web application.

3. Type the following script: <script> window.location="http://www.google.com" </script> into the input area and save the script into the web application. This will upload the script into the database used to interact with the web application.

4. Wait for unsuspecting user to access the modified list. 

5. Acting as a potential victim, access https://sbr2020.herokuapp.com and login with the following credentials: username cocho@gmail.com and password: password.

6. Select Groceries list by selecting the update button. This will access the list from the database and run the script previously uploaded to the web application and redirect the user to a potentially malicious web application.

7. You are now rediected to http://www.google.com for this example, however, this can easily be a malicious web application owned by an adversary.
