# SQL Injection
SQL injection is an attack that takes advantage of improper user validation to exploit the database layer of an application. Additionally, user-supplied data when passed into the database engine without sanitization can cause leakage of secret information and possibly database corruption. This attack can will begin by identifying a location in a webpage that has some form of input. At this point, simple SQL commands can be used as input to identify whether the webpage is effectively validating input. If the input is not properly validated, more targeted commands can be run to ultimately have the webpage return sensitive information such as user credentials from the database.

# Broken Authentication
Broken authentication is a form of vulnerability that an adversary can use to authenticate into a web page and impersonate a legitimate user. This can be done in many ways such as taking advantage of a web application that fails to lock out accounts after multiple failed attempts to brute force a weak password. Adversaries can also use information retrieved from the webpage after a failed login attempts to identify whether a username or password is correct. Improperly handling sessions by allowing users remain logged in for a long period of time despite leaving the computer unattended can enable an adversary to access the userâ€™s session on that computer.
