# Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfiguration is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.<sup>[1]</sup>

### Exercise
For this excercise we will be downloading OWASP ZAP, an open source penetration testing tool. Download the appropriate installer from ZAP’s download location at https://www.zaproxy.org/download/ and execute the installer.

### DISCLAIMER:    
> You should only use ZAP to attack an application you have permission to test with an active attack. Because this is a simulation that acts like a real attack, actual damage can be done to a site’s functionality, data, etc. If you are worried about using ZAP, you can prevent it from causing harm (though ZAP’s functionality will be significantly reduced) by switching to safe mode. 
> To switch ZAP to safe mode, click the arrow on the mode dropdown on the main toolbar to expand the dropdown list and select Safe Mode.<sup>[2]</sup>
