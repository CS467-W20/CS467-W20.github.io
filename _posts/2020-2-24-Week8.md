# Insecure Deserialization
Serialization is the process where an object is encoded into a byte-stream which can be transferred across a network. It is then de-serialized to recover the object. Depending on the application, serialized objects may include executable instructions or authentication credentials. These serialized objects may be modified by an adversary. If the application is not able to detect tampering, it can allow the adversary to achieve effects like remote code execution or privilege escalation on the server.

### Exercise 
**Note:** Since this excercise gains access into the server we are unable to exploit the live vulnerable web app hosted in Heroku as they have added security on their back to prevent this kinds of attacks.    

1. Setup: Clone or download https://github.com/ashwinsawant/sbr.git and checkout branch Deserial.

2. Open Burp, go to Proxy > Options and make sure 127.0.0.1:8080 Proxy Listener is enabled. Go to Firefox and change proxy to match Burp settings.

3. On Burp go to Proxy > Intercept and make sure Intercept is on. On Firefox go to localhost:3000/login and enter the following credentials at the login page: 
- Email: cocho@gmail.com 
- Password: password      
We have just intercepted traffic and now have access to the encryted cookie along with the request format. Click on Action button and Send to Repeater. We will use later on in the process.
