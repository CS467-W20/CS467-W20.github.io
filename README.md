Our team will create a simple web app with all the needed infrastructure to perform a series of different web attacks.
From each web attack we will learn the vulnerabilities being exploited and we will attempt to harden the web app accordingly.
The final outcome will be a how to guide to be posted on GitHub. This guide will have step by step instructions on how to 
achieve each specific web attack.
