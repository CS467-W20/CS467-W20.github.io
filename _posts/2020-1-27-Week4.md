# SQL Injection
SQL injection is an attack that takes advantage of improper user validation to exploit the database layer of an application. Additionally, user-supplied data when passed into the database engine without sanitization can cause leakage of secret information and possibly database corruption. This attack can will begin by identifying a location in a webpage that has some form of input. At this point, simple SQL commands can be used as input to identify whether the webpage is effectively validating input. If the input is not properly validated, more targeted commands can be run to ultimately have the webpage return sensitive information such as user credentials from the database.

# Broken Authentication
Broken authentication is a form of vulnerability that an adversary can use to authenticate into a web page and impersonate a legitimate user. This can be done in many ways such as taking advantage of a web application that fails to lock out accounts after multiple failed attempts to brute force a weak password. Adversaries can also use information retrieved from the webpage after a failed login attempts to identify whether a username or password is correct. Improperly handling sessions by allowing users remain logged in for a long period of time despite leaving the computer unattended can enable an adversary to access the user’s session on that computer.     
### Excercise
For this excercise you will need to download and install Burp Suite Community Edition (<https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload>) a free cibersecurity tool.

1. Create a text file called username.txt and enter the following commonly used emails:
- <default@hotmail.com>
- <admin@msn.com>
- <user123@gmail.com>
- <janedoe@yahoo.com>
- <sql@aol>     

2. Create a text file called passwords.txt and enter the following commonly used passwords:
- admin
- P@ssword
- user123
- default
- monkey     

3. Open Burp Suite and go through the following menus    
**- NEXT**

**- START BURP**     

![Burp, Start New Project Page](/images/BurpStart.JPG)        

**- PROXY > OPTIONS**  Make sure there is a proxy listener set up for 127.0.0.1:8080 and that it is running.

4. Open Firefox and click on the three horizontal lines on the upper right hand corner and click on OPTIONS or PREFERENCES (depending on what version you are on)      

![Firefox, Options Menu](/images/FirefoxOptions.JPG)

**- Before you make any changes here make sure you make a note of the original settings. Now change the settings to Manual Proxy Configuration to match the picture below.**

5. On Firefox go to our vulnerable website at <http://sbr2020.herokuapp.com/login> and enter the following email and password combination: 
- Email: fake@email.com
- Password: bogusPass
- Click the Sign In button  (Do not worry if nothing happens, the next steps are completed on Burp Suite)

6. Open Burp Suite and go to PROXY > INTERCEPT and you should have something that looks similar to this.    

**- Click on ACTIONS and SEND TO INTRUDER and stop the listener by clicking on INTERCEPT IS ON button. You should also at this time go to Firefox and turn your Network settings back to their original status.**    

![Burp, Intercept](/images/BurpProxyIntercept.JPG)   

**- Go to INTRUDER > POSITIONS and change the values between the § signs to 'username' and 'passswords, and then change the attack type to CLUSTER BOMB ' as shown below**    

![Burp, Intercept Position](/images/BurpInterceptPosition.JPG)  

**- Go to INTRUDER > PAYLOADS and make sure PAYLOAD SETS is set to 1 and on PAYLOAD OPTIONS click LOAD. Find the username.txt file you created and load. Then click select on PAYLOAD SETS set 2 and on PAYLOAD OPTIONS click LOAD and find the passwords.txt file you created and load.**   

![Burp, Intercept Payloads](/images/BurpInterceptPayload1.JPG)  

**- Go to INTRUDER > OPTIONS > GREP MACTH and select clear.**

![Burp, Intercept Options](/images/BurpInterceptOptions1.JPG)  

**- Go to INTRUDER > OPTIONS > REDIRECTIONS and select ON-SITE ONLY.**   

![Burp, Intercept Options](/images/BurpInterceptOptions2.JPG)  

**- You are ready to start the attack. Go to the top of the OPTIONS page and on the right top hand you will see a START ATTACK button, click on it. A new window will open showing every combination of usernames and passwords being tried on the webpage**

7. Analyze results from attack page and you will see on the length column only one is different from the others. Lets test these credentials on our webpage. **Go to  <http://sbr2020.herokuapp.com/login> and enter:** 
- Email: janedow@yahoo.com
- Password: monkey   

![Firefox, sbr2020 Web App](/images/loginPage2.JPG)    

**- You are now in the website using someone elses credentials obtained through a broken authentication attack!**
